          I have read and fully understand the SpringRock
          non-disclosure/confidentiality Policy attached herewith.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have asked all questions I have concerning the policy and these have
          been clarified by my manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          I agree that I shall not during, or at any time after the termination
          of my employment with the Company, disclose or divulge to others
          including future employers, any trade secrets, confidential
          information, or any other proprietary data of the Company in violation
          of this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          That upon the termination of my employment from the Company: I shall
          return to the Company all documents and property of the Company,
          including but not necessarily limited to: drawings, blueprints,
          reports, manuals, correspondence, customer lists, computer programs,
          and all other materials and all copies thereof relating in any way to
          the Company's business, or in any way obtained by me during the course
          of employ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will report all violations or suspected violations of the policy to
          management immediately and that I will be asked to confirm in writing
          whether or not any such violations have occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that any violation of this policy or failure to report
          violations of a policy will result in disciplinary action up to and
          including dismissal.
